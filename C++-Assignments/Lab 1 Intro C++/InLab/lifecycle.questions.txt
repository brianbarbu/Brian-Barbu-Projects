LifeCycle Questions

Commenting out the prototype for getMaxMyObj() causes a missing prototype error. C++ needs protoypes so the compiler knows what to process as it gives a structure to the function. 

Question: 

Prototypes are used so the structure is known and information will only have to be read once, but is possible to force process the program in C++?
